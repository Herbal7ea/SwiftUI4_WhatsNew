# SwiftUI4_WhatsNew
This is the code from Paul Hudson's video in a single place:
[What's new in SwiftUI for iOS 16?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4obxmYn2AoI)

I've organized this into one place to quickly review and practice the what's new

What's New:
- Tap Location
- Grid View
- Share Sheet
- New Navigation
- Sharing
- Dates
- Search
- Gradients
- Shadows
- Flexibile Layouts
- Dynamic Type Size
- Symbol Animation
- Text Limit
- Font Animation
- Growing Text Field
- Font Animation
- Toggle with Arrays
